Hi I am Rajat, theoretical chemist in the Ohio State University. Mostly interested in implementing new methods for simulating challenging molecular electronic structure. My work's primarily based on python-driven package: PyScf. Also interested in using machine learning tools in order to tune the accuracy of our methods.
